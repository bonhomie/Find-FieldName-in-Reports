# Find FieldName used in Reports

When cleaning up unused CustomFields in SObjects, Salesforce warns if it is used for Workflows, Triggers and within Apex code. However it does not warn which Reports use the CustomField.

This Visualforce pages allows a quick search within the Reports metadata to determine if a particular FieldName is currently being used and will return the list of Reports in a Visualforce page with link to the Report id.
